## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a terminal that provides you the opportunity to pull/push projects/code from Github.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is where you do all of the work for editing code, pull/push & bringing it to your computer. GitHub is the "Cloud" where all of the work/code is stored.
3. Why do we create a branch? 1. so you can track all changes, 2. so that multiple people can be working on it all at once. 3. If there are bugs you can fix it in your branch instead of corrupting the main.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? From my understanding a pull request is used if multiple people are working on the same branch & it allows you to track changes
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout main
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git pull'  is taking your git commits and automatically merges. 'git fetch' will store your commits but doesn't merge them. 'git merge' will merge those commits from 'git fetch' once you are finished reviewing them
7. What is a merge conflict? This can happen when multiple people are working on the same code and they edit a line of code differently or one could edit and one could delete. 
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You would need to compare the code edits that caused the conflict & decide who's branch of code you're going to keep or make a brand new string of code all together
